Concordia Bootcamp Final Project

## Description

I am a food lover, when I know I could decide what I want to do for my final project, I decided right away that I want to create a an app about restaurants, and here it is!
This project is made during the final two weeks of Concordia Bootcamp study. The technologies involved are React, Node, Express, MongoDB, and YelpApi.
( all styles were created with pure css, no libraries )
