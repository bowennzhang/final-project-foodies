Concordia Bootcamp Final Project

## Description

I am a food lover, when I knew I could decide what I want to do for my final project, I decided right away that I want to create an app about restaurants, and here it is! This project was made during the final two weeks of Concordia Bootcamp study. The technologies involved are React, Node, Express, MongoDB, and YelpApi. ( all styles were created with pure css, no libraries )
