              The Old Port of Montreal is the historic port of Montreal, Quebec,
              Canada. Located adjacent to Old Montreal, it stretches for over 2
              km along the Saint Lawrence River. It was used as early as 1611,
              when French fur traders used it as a trading post.

              Montreal Chinatown was established in the late 19th century with
              the arrival of Chinese immigrants from western Canada who came to
              work on the Canadian Pacific Railway. Though just a couple of
              blocks long, the district offers a wide selection of Asian
              eateries and shops selling traditional handicrafts and souvenirs.

              Mount Royal is a large intrusive rock hill or small mountain in
              the city of Montreal, immediately west of Downtown Montreal,
              Quebec, Canada. The best-known hypothesis for the origin of the
              name Montreal is that the name is taken from Mount Royal.
